        Screen After encounter got spiced up

    <Backend nerd stuff>
        More art, as well as a loot-drop system
        Rare cards droprate is calculated as:

            if(RandomValue()*5 - "encounters since last picked rare" <= 1)

        meaning that a rare is garunteed after the fifth encounter
